# FastWeight-BCAP

[← Technique leaderboard](../technique-inventory.md)

FastWeight-BCAP adds detached bounded memory to the BCAP trainer. The memory writes from arriving frames and conditions the task-owned generator and critic. Its strict online descendant disables replay. The original reader emphasizes recent frame change; it does not by itself establish delayed recall or use the accumulated associative matrix as a query.

[Implementation](../../../particlestream/memory.py) · [Protocol](../../../EXPERIMENTATION.md) · [Terminology](../../../RESEARCH_GLOSSARY.md)

Each section describes one exact global recipe. Configuration and parent deltas come from the declarations; results come from Forge's current source-bound receipts. Required and stretch evidence stay separate. A final metric can meet its gate while the sustained verdict fails: every one of the last five checks must pass.

The installed engine is pinned to ParticleGAN/Forge 0.9.7. Older version or replay wording in declaration history describes provenance; the effective configuration below controls execution.

[Exact declaration](../../../configs/forge/ideas/online-fast-weight-bcap.json)

Parent: [`fast-weight-bcap`](fastweight-bcap.md#fast-weight-bcap).

Declared changes:

- Strict online baseline: explicitly disable every replay path; preserve the complete historical optimization recipe
- One chronological observation per update; real/fake batch_size=1; causal serve-before-arrival prediction

### Configuration delta from parent

**Historical, read-only.** This declaration does not satisfy explicit `replay_policy=none` with `rehearsal_batch=0`; the executor rejects it before touching its saved evidence. It has no current qualification score.
